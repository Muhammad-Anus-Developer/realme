    <p class="fod">About realme smartphone battery</p>
    <br>
    <p class="fontgrey">There is no special requirement for the first time charge. The battery is designed to have a good performance in a wide range of ambient temperatures, with 16° C to 25° C （61° F to 77° F）as the ideal comfort zone.Its maximum lifespan cannot be reached with an unoriginal charger or under extreme temperature.Charging at temperatures above 45 °C will degrade battery performance, resulting in slower charging.When using your device in a very cold environment, you may notice a decrease in battery life, but this condition is temporary. Once the battery’s temperature returns to its normal operating range, its performance will return to normal as well.To avoid battery damage, realme smartphone will automatically stop charging at extreme ambient temperatures, and alerts you “Temperature is too low/high, the battery cannot be charged”, “Temperature is too low/high, the battery cannot be fully charged”.</p>

        <p class="fontgrey">We recommend the original phone case and screen protector to provide double protect to your realme phone.
